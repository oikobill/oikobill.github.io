I am a senior at the University of California, Berkeley studying *Statistics*, with a broad interest in **Statistical Machine Learning**, **Optimization** and **Theoretical Computer Science**. I enjoy solving messy real-world data problems and reading about elegant, intuitive concepts from Computer Science, Statistics and Mathematics.

After I graduate, I will be returning to [Two Sigma Investments](https://www.twosigma.com/) as a Quantitative Researcher. In the past, I was a Quantitative Research Intern at Two Sigma Investments (Summer 2018) and a Machine Learning Intern at [UnifyID](https://unify.id/) where I worked on Deep Learning for Computer Vision with a focus on **Transfer Learning** and **Sequence to Sequence Models**. For more information about my professional qualifications, check out my [resume](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aGczdiPDUEI2bRPxQ1jUxYdsIvD8PvYp8unmRFXQQNA/edit?usp=sharing) and [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vasilis-oikonomou-606571107/).

I am passionate about teaching. You can find a complete list of positions I have held over time <a href="/teaching">here</a>.

Outside of school, I enjoy [reading](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/91812999-vasilis), basketball and travelling.
